### Hello!

My name is Emily Crawford and I am a junior in Information Sciences at the University of Illinois. Here you will find a collection of projects I have completed over the past year or so. Find the snow visualization I helped work on [here](https://vis.cs.illinois.edu/weather/historic-snowfall-and-snow-depth/).
